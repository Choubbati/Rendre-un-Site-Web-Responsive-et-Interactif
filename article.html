                    Payday 2 may predate Payday 3 by a decade, but the former still
                    remains popular while the latter has struggled. Now, publisher
                    Starbreeze has lined up Sidetrack Games to work on Payday 2 updates
                    on PC and keep those players satisfied. Sidetrack was previously
                    known as the M.U.G. Team in the Payday modding community, and the
                    studio also worked on updates for RAID: World War 2 after that
                    game's lifecycle came to an end. According to Starbreeze,
                    Sidetrack's first Payday 2 update will go live on October 23, with a
                    focus "on the stability of the game and improving the overall player
                    experience." Future updates are planned for "quality-of-life
                    improvements and general game fixes."
